Dataset can be found in here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/data)

The product recommendation system is built based on the customer historical data. It involves two filtering approaches: collaborative filtering and demographic filtering

Based on the model, it will output the following: 
- Top 1 recommended product for each customer
